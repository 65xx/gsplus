# About
This is an early release of an experimental project to modernize the
KEGS/GSport emulator platform and eventually extend it.

# Install
Go to https://apple2.gs/plus to get the latest downloads for your system.

# Usage Notes
You need to provide the ROM file and disk images and a config file.  I'd
recommend you just drop it in your current GSport or KEGS folder and run it
from there.

See the doc/gsplusmanual.pdf file for much more complete documentation.

# Build Instructions
==========================
See the /doc/ directory for "Developer-Quickstart" docs which cover building
for the various platforms.
