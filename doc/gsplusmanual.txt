Modern cross-platform Apple IIgs emulator and tools based on KEGS
Manual Version: Initial Draft
Date: 2016-05-01
Overview & Purpose
This is an early release of an experimental project to modernize the KEGS/GSport emulator platform and eventually extend it. 
The first steps are represented here.  This release features a new SDL2 driver.  SDL or "Simple DirectMedia Layer" enables the writing of one cross-platform driver to handle input and output (video, mouse, keyboard, audio, joystick).  The hope is that I can leverage the multi-platform nature of SDL to provide first-class support for the major platforms supported by SDL, which includes Mac OSX, Windows and Linux.
Currently, five builds are being supported:
* OSX (SDL2 driver)
* Ubuntu (SDL2 driver)
* Ubuntu (SDL driver)
* Ubuntu (X11 driver)
* Window (Win32 driver)
There are more platforms still in the codebase, and some, like Raspberry Pi will probably be added to official support.  But I may drop some of the older platforms like OS/2.

Getting started
1. Download the emulator and put it in a folder
2. Download the Apple IIgs Firmware ROMs, for either a ROM01 or ROM03 machine.  (If you have a real IIgs, there are ways to save it from your machine as well.)
3. Download some Apple IIgs software.  (I recommend the excellent Apple IIgs dedicated site, http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/ )
(If you have a real IIgs, you can transfer your disks using ADTPro http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/ )
4. Edit your config:
   1. By hand… edit the config file (config.txt, config.gsplus, or .gsplus)
   2. While the emulator is running… hit F4 to enter config menu. 
   1. Boot the Apple IIgs by running the emulator
   1. Windows:                gsplus.exe
   2. Mac/Ubuntu:                ./gsplus
Emulator Hot-Keys
There are several keys used to interact with the emulator while it is running.  Here’s a quick list of the main hot-keys and what they do.
F4         - Configuration menu
F5         - Config menu
F6         - Toggle System Speed  (1, 2.8, 8, ∞ MHz )
F7         - Toggle Fast Disk Emulation
F9         - Invert Paddles
F10         - Toggle a2vid_palette (?)
F11         - Toggle Fullscreen Mode
F12         - RESET Key (i.e. - “Ctrl-F12” =  “Ctrl-Reset” on an Apple II)
Other Input/Output
   1. Mouse and keyboard should automatically work
   2. Joystick with SDL2 driver is known to be working.  The axes and buttons are not yet configurable.  Better info forthcoming.
   3. There are drivers for serial controller, ImageWriter (II?) printer, and networking.  I’m not currently familiar with the state of these drivers or their usage.  More info will be added as I take time to research more of the modules.
Configuration Menu
Enter the configuration menu at any time while running gsport by hitting <F4>.
The configuration options are loaded from, and saved to, a configuration text file.  The file can be named one of the following: config.txt, config.gsplus, or .gsplus.
If you are just starting out, it’s recommended to use the configuration menu versus editing the file yourself.

Most important, you can use the Disk Configuration menu option to “mount” and “eject” disks.          
Debugger Commands
Enter from the debugger prompt (Shift-F6)
GSport Debugger help (courtesy Fredric Devernay)
General command syntax: [bank]/[address][command]  
e.g. 'e1/0010B' to set a breakpoint at the interrupt jump pt
Enter all addresses using lower-case.  As with the IIgs monitor, you can omit the bank number after having set it: 'e1/0010B' followed by '14B' will set breakpoints at e1/0010 and e1/0014
