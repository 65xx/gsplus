Getting started 
===============

1. Download the emulator package and put it in a folder
2. Download the Apple IIgs Firmware ROMs, for either a ROM01 or ROM03 machine.
   (If you have a real IIgs, there are ways to save it from your machine too.)
   Try: ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/emulators/rom_images/
3. Download some Apple IIgs software.
   I recommend the excellent Apple IIgs dedicated site, 
     http://www.whatisthe2gs.apple2.org.za/ 
   If you have a real IIgs, you can transfer your disks using ADTPro 
     http://adtpro.sourceforge.net/ 
4. Edit your config:
   You can manually edit the config.txt file  
    .. or while the emulator is running... hit F4 to enter config menu.
   Set up the ROM to point to your IIgs ROM file from step 2.
   Set up the slots to point to disks from step 3.
5. Boot the Apple IIgs by running the emulator
   Windows:        gsplus32.exe
   Mac/Ubuntu:     ./gsplus
