# When building on Raspberry Pi, you need to get the hardware
# accelerated graphics driver enabled with SDL2.  
# We borrow the SDL2 build from RetroPie which takes care of this for us.

git clone https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup
cd RetroPie-Setup

# Then build GSplus like any other *nix system
