## SOME NOTES ON SETTING UP GITLAB RUNNER TO BUILD ON WINDOWS
# Based on: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md

## STEP 1 - Install Gitlab Runner
# Download from page above, run CMD prompt as Administrator and then run the runner exe in there

## STEP 2 - Register it with your server
# First open Administrator CMD prompt then run the following commands.

# REGISTER: Enter your Gitlab CI details
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe register

## STEP 3 - Install Service
# Note the use of ".\IEUser" to indicate local account!
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe install --user .\IEUser --password Passw0rd!

## STEP 4 - Start service
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe start

# If you have any problems with the service not starting due to:
# "Failed to start gitlab-runner: The service did not start due to a 
#  logon failure."
# Try going to Services and edit the properties of the gitlab-runner service.
# Go to the "Log On" tab and re-enter the password/credentials and see if 
# that helps.


## STEP 5 - Make sure gitlab-runner is using the correct shell
# It defaults to CMD, go to the directory where the gitlab-runner
# commands were run and edit the "config.toml" file.  Under the line
# that says:  executor = "shell"
#       add:  shell = "bash"
#
# Also, make sure that if you type "bash" <enter>  from a CMD prompt,
# that it runs the Cygwin shell.  If it can't find the bash command, 
# go to the Environment Variables Control Panel for your computer and
# add "c:\cygwin\bin" to your PATH variable.





## PREREQUISITE 
# The project is currently being build in Cygwin.
# I install Cygwin with all "Devel" and "Perl" packages.
# I also search for and add any SDL2 or FreeType libs just in case.
# You'll also need git installed for cmdline usage on Windows.
# Add your ~/.ssh/id_rsa using git bash (or cygwin) so that 
# gitlab runner can check out your project
