## SOME NOTES ON SETTING UP GITLAB RUNNER TO BUILD ON WINDOWS
# Based on: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md

## STEP 1 - Install Gitlab Runner
# Download from page above, run CMD prompt as Administrator and then run the runner exe in there

## STEP 2 - Register it with your server
# First open Administrator CMD prompt then run the following commands.

# REGISTER: Enter your Gitlab CI details
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe register

# INSTALL SERVICE: Note the use of ".\IEUser" to indicate local account!
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe install --user .\IEUser --password Passw0rd!

# START SERVICE
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe start

# If you have any problems with the service not starting due to:
# "Failed to start gitlab-runner: The service did not start due to a 
#  logon failure."
# Try going to Services and edit the properties of the gitlab-runner service.
# Go to the "Log On" tab and re-enter the password/credentials and see if 
# that helps.






## PREREQUISITE 
# The project is currently being build in Cygwin.
# I install Cygwin with all "Devel" and "Perl" packages.
# I also search for and add any SDL2 or FreeType libs just in case.
# You'll also need git installed for cmdline usage on Windows.
# Add your ~/.ssh/id_rsa using git bash (or cygwin) so that 
# gitlab runner can check out your project
