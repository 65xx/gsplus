## PREREQUISITE AKA SETTING UP A FRESH VM OR DEV COMPUTER
#
# Install your Win7/Win10 VM
# Install VirtualBox additions in your VM
#
# (optional)  add build user
# Make user an admin, give it service privs
#  ... Local Security Policy -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment -> Log on as a service
#
# install Cygwin
# add cygwin bin dir to env path
#
# install git for windows w/ git bash  http://git-scm.com/download/win
git config --global user.name "Dagen Brock"
git config --global user.email "dagenbrock@gmail.com"
# (set up your key(s))
# Add your ~/.ssh/id_rsa using git bash (or cygwin) so that
# gitlab runner can check out your project
#
# The project is currently being build in Cygwin.
# I install Cygwin with all "Devel" and "Perl" packages.
# I also search for and add any SDL2 or FreeType libs just in case.


## SOME NOTES ON SETTING UP GITLAB RUNNER TO BUILD ON WINDOWS
# Based on: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/blob/master/docs/install/windows.md

## STEP 1 - Install Gitlab Runner
# Download from page above, run CMD prompt as Administrator and then run the runner exe in there

## STEP 2 - Register it with your server
# First open Administrator CMD prompt then run the following commands.

# REGISTER: Enter your Gitlab CI details - (Token is in Gitlab->Admin-Runners)
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe register
# enter gitlab url
# enter gitlab runner token
# enter tag of "windows"
gitlab-runner.exe register -n \
  --url http://centralserv.gotgeeks.com/ci \
  --registration-token UqGC2qvJmvU1QBK3mx4b \
  --executor shell \
  --description "WinBuild"
  --tag-list "windows"

gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe -n   --url http://centralserv.gotgeeks.com/ci   --registration-token 5a1f60647cf7fe3eb5c7fa87e59bf7   --executor shell   --description "WinDork10" --tag-list "windows,win32"

## STEP 3 - Install Service
# Note the use of ".\IEUser" to indicate local account!
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe install --user .\IEUser --password Passw0rd!
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe install --user .\Builder --password Bu1ld3r!

## STEP 4 - Start service
gitlab-ci-multi-runner-windows-386.exe start

## STEP 4.5 - if you get a "failed due to logon" message above, you may need to grant "logon as a service" privs
#To add the "Log on as a service" right to an account on your local computer
#To open Local Security Policy, click Start, point to Control Panel, point to Administrative Tools, and then double-click Local Security Policy.
#In the console tree, double-click Local Policies, and then click User Rights Assignment.
#In the details pane, double-click Log on as a service.
#Click Add User or Group, and then add the appropriate account to the list of accounts that possess the Log on as a service right.

# If you have any other problems with the service not starting due to:
# "Failed to start gitlab-runner: The service did not start due to a logon failure."
# Try going to Services and edit the properties of the gitlab-runner service.
# Go to the "Log On" tab and re-enter the password/credentials and see if
# that helps.


## STEP 5 - Make sure gitlab-runner is using the correct shell
# It defaults to CMD, go to the directory where the gitlab-runner
# commands were run and edit the "config.toml" file.  Under the line
# that says:  executor = "shell"
#       add:  shell = "bash"
#
# Also, make sure that if you type "bash" <enter>  from a CMD prompt,
# that it runs the Cygwin shell.  If it can't find the bash command,
# go to the Environment Variables Control Panel for your computer and
# add "c:\cygwin\bin" to your PATH variable.
